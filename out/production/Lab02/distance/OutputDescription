Initial Output:
Displacement = 1.73
Prof. Keith is on the move! His Velocity =0.35
Encountered an error: For input string: "∞"

Description: Point3D one has the default x, y, z, value: 0, 0, 0. Point3D two has the x, y, z value: 1, 1, 1.
so the distanceTo method will return the distance of two points, which is 1.73. Then the velocity
will calculates the velocity of the two points, which is 1.37/5 = 0.35. If the elapsed time changes into 0,
it will throw the illegalArgumentationException, which will encounter an error.

Output after swapping:
Displacement = 1.73
Encountered an error: For input string: "∞"

Description: After swapping we still get the same displacement, but it will throw illegalArgumentationException
at the first attempt to calculate the velocity. so the try structure will also break after that and the process will
not be progressing after an illegalArgumentException occurs.
